Features
Meal Recommendations Based on Dietary Preferences:

The class supports various dietary preferences, including vegetarian, vegan, non-vegetarian, gluten-free, and low-carb. Users can select their preferred diet, and the recommender will provide meal options that fit within those guidelines, ensuring that dietary restrictions and preferences are respected.
Customizable Meal Suggestions:

Recommendations are not just based on dietary preferences; they also consider the user's age and weight. This allows the recommender to suggest meals that are more suitable for different life stages and body types. For instance, it may suggest lighter meals for younger individuals or more nutrient-dense options for older users.
Comprehensive Meal Planning:

The class can generate a complete meal plan for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Users receive three meal suggestions in one call, making it easy to plan their daily nutrition without needing to make separate requests for each meal.
Randomized Meal Selection:

To provide variety and prevent meal fatigue, the class selects meals randomly from the defined options. This randomness ensures that users can experience different meals each time they request a plan, keeping their diet exciting and diverse.
Simple and Intuitive Interface:

The class is designed to be user-friendly, with a straightforward interface that allows users to quickly input their data and receive meal recommendations. The methods are clearly defined, making it easy for users to integrate the class into their applications or scripts.
Example Usage and Documentation:

The README includes clear example usage, which helps users understand how to implement and use the NutritionRecommender class effectively. This encourages more users to adopt the class in their projects or personal applications.
